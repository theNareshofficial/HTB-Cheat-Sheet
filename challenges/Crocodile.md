## Learning outcomeðŸ“–
<p>
In the first tier, you will gain essential skills in the world of cybersecurity pen-testing. You'll start by learning how to connect to various services, such as FTP, SMB, Telnet, Rsync, and RDP anonymously. Next, you'll discover the power of Nmap, a valuable tool for identifying open ports on target systems, allowing you to assess their vulnerabilities. Lastly, you'll explore connecting to a MongoDB server, adding a valuable layer to your penetration testing knowledge. This tier will lay a strong foundation for your journey into the realm of cybersecurity.
